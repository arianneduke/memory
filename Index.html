		<div>The images printed on the tarot cards are from the Tarot of Marseilles, which was originally printed in 1831-1838 by the Swiss card factory of Johann Georg Rauch, and reprinted later by AGMuller in 1965.

Tarot is believed to have originated in Italy in the 15th Century and was introduced to France in 1499 when the French conquered Milan. Tarot later died out in Italy but survived in France and Switzerland

Before being used for divination purposes Tarot was used to play the card games Troccas and Troggu.

It wasn’t until the 18th century that the 1st known occultist popularized tarot as a tool for divination.  EndFragment</div>
